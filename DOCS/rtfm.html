It is the wish of myself and the LCA that ZEUS-MP be a useful code to
you.  Additionally, it is my wish that the documentation on this
web site help you get started running ZEUS-MP with a minimum of fuss.
Toward that end, your feedback on this website is welcomed and encouraged.
Support for this code will be strictly limited by the guidelines I
provide below (I'm not paid to do code support; this is strictly pro
bono work), but within those constraints I will do my best to answer
questions and be helpful.

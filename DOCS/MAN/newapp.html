<H3>The Problem Generator Subroutine</H3>

A new application is created via the construction of a problem generator
subroutine which is identified in subroutine <b>setup</b> by the
CPP macro "PROBLEM".  During compilation, the C preprocessor searches
for the string PROBLEM and replaces it with the name of the appropriate
subroutine specified in the Makefile via "-DPROBLEM=..." in the
ZMP_CPP command line.  The tar file is shipped with the Makefile written
to define <b>blast</b> as the subroutine of choice. A second macro,
PROBRES, defines the name of a subroutine to be called if this application
is to be continued from a restart file.  As an example, I will discuss
the <b>rshock</b> subroutine as a simple example of how to construct an application.

<BR>
<H3>Module Declaration</H3>

Because this version of ZEUS-MP follows a basic Fortran 90 programming
model, F77-style INCLUDE statements have been dropped in favor of
F90 USE statements which refer to modules that serve the analogous
function of the INCLUDE files in F77 codes.  The modules
referenced by these USE statements are collected in the source
file mod_files.F, which is the first file processed during
compilation.  Of the modules listed in rshock.F, <b>real_prec,
config, param, grid, field, root, bndry, and mpipar</b> should be
regarded as mandatory for your generator regardless of the physics
set you wish to include.  The CPP #ifdef-#else-#endif construction
enclosing <b>mpiyes and mpino</b> must also be included.  The <b>radiation
and opac</b> modules are needed if radiation is to be included in your
problem.

<p>
Looking underneath the module list in rshock.F, you will notice what I regard
as the most important line in any Fortran code:

<p>
implicit NONE

<p>
Always, ALWAYS, <b>ALWAYS</b> include this line in every fortran subroutine
you write!  This is the single most effective bug-filter available to you.
End of editorial.

<p>
<H3>Reading the PGEN Namelist</H3>

The first task of the Problem Generator subroutine is naturally to read
the user-customized PGEN namelist containing all parameters unique
to the application.  The READ statement is enclosed by a Fortran
IF-ENDIF construct which tells the code that, in the case of a
parallel calculation, only the "root" process (myid_w = 0) should
execute the READ statement.  Inside the Fortran IF-ENDIF is a
CPP #ifdef-#endif construct that hides MPI-specific code from
the compiler if the macro MPI_USED is not defined in the Makefile.
If this macro has been defined, then the enclosed code ensures
that data read by the root process is broadcast to all the 
other processes in a parallel calculation.

<p>
<H3>Initializing Field Variables and Boundary Variables</H3>

Once the PGEN namelist has been read, the main job of the
Problem Generator routine is to initialize ZEUS-MP's field
arrays for density ("d"), gas energy density ("e"), and
the three components of velocity ("v1," "v2," and "v3").
If magnetic fields were included, one would also need to
specify initial values of b1, b2, and b3.  Because this
problem includes radiation, we need to initialize "er,"
the radiation energy density.

<p>
This problem also makes use of prescribed constant boundary values
along the outer 1-boundary.  In either of the two zmp_inp files
that can be used with the <b>rshock</b> problem generator, zmp_inp.subrshk
and zmp_inp.suprshk (<i>sub</i>critical and <i>super</i>critical
radiating shocks, respectively), the OIB boundary value namelist 
specifies that "inflow" boundary conditions are to be applied on
the outer I boundary (nois(1)=nois(2)=3).  Setting nois(1)=3
means that the hydro module will use prescribed values of density,
gas energy density, and velocity at the outer boundary.  Setting
nois(2)=3 further specifies that the radiation module will also
rely on a prescribed value for er in the outer boundary cells.

<p>
The outer boundary values for density, gas energy, and 3 velocity
components are fed into the code directly from the zmp_inp file
via fois(1), fois(2), and fois(3-5), respectively.  The value
of fois(2) is interpreted by <b>rshock</b> as a material temperature
from which the boundary value of gas energy is derived.  Rather
than specifying the boundary radiation energy in zmp_inp, subroutine
<b>rshock</b> computes fois(12) internally from the value for
gas temperature.  Because the initial model is constructed in
radiative equilibrium, the gas and radiation temperatures will
be identical, so it makes sense to compute fois(12) inside <b>rshock</b>
rather than specifying it independently in zmp_inp.

<p>
With the field variables and required boundary conditions determined,
the problem is initialized.  The file rshock.F contains
a second subroutine, <b>rshockres</b>, which would be called in
place of <b>rshock</b> if the calculation were picked up from a
restart file.  When a calculation is begun from scratch, subroutine
<b>mstart</b> calls subroutine <b>setup</b>, with then calls 
subroutine PROBLEM (your problem generator) to configure the application.
When a calculation is begun from a restart dump (irestart=1 in namelist
rescon), subroutine <b>mstart</b> calls <b>restart</b> in place of
<b>setup</b>; subroutine <b>restart</b> calls subroutine PROBRES --
your problem-restart routine -- in place of PROBLEM.  As with the
macro PROBLEM, PROBRES is specified in the ZMP_CPP line in the Makefile.

<H3>The Basics</H3>

The ZEUS-MP binary executable is called "zeusmp.x" and is located under
<b>zeusmp2/exe90</b>.  The only input file required by the test problems
supplied is "zmp_inp", the input parameter file documented at length
in Part 3 of this user guide.  If the code is compiled as a serial
code, then simply typing "zeusmp.x" at the terminal prompt will launch
the code.  In the more common case of parallel execution, the method
of launching the code is -- as experienced users are well aware --
entirely dependent upon the platform.  I will therefore leave it up
the to User to determine how to launch a job on his platform of choice.

<BR>
<H3>Execution Status</H3>

ZEUS-MP is wired to write some information to the TTY as a calculation
progresses.  A parameter called <b>mbatch</b> read in namelist PCON
allows the user to interactively query the code's status if mbatch=0.
<B>I DO NOT RECOMMEND USING THIS FEATURE,</B> reason being that on
the IBM SP computers, accidently leaving mbatch=0 when a job is run in
batch mode will cause all Hell to break loose and zillions of "illegal
character" complaints to be generated during code execution.  I don't
understand why this happens, and I'm far too lazy to care.  If you like
to live dangerously and wish to learn more about this feature, look in
the subroutine <b>intchk.F</b> in the <b>src90</b> subdirectory to see what
the legal prompt commands are.  When radiation transport is turned off,
a block of code in <b>zeusmp.F</b> periodically writes information on
cycle number, evolution time, and timestep to TTY.  When radiation
transport is turned on, a block of code at the bottom of <b>grey_fld.F</b>
is active instead, writing cycle/time/timestep information and information
on (1) how many Newton-Raphson iterations were required to solve the coupled
radiation-energy equations, and (2) the average number of conjugate gradient
linear solver iterations were needed for each N-R iteration.  Yes, some of
us actually care about that.

<p>
ZEUS-MP also writes some information in a log file called "zmp_log".  If
all goes well in a calculation, this file will only contain the values of
all the parameters in the <b>zmp_inp</b> input namelists as they have been
read in.  If the code has numerical difficulty and has to cut the timestep
size, some information about this will be logged in this file.  This will
be familiar to users of ZEUS-3D.

<P>
<H3>Output Data Files</H3>

ZEUS-MP follows the convention that, regardless of the type of output
file being written, each processor in a parallel calculation writes
its private data to a unique file.  For example, if HDF files are
being written (XHDF4 = .TRUE.), then an 8-processor calculation
will dump 8 files every time an HDF dump is performed.  As an
example, suppose that a 3D calculation was distributed across
8 processors so each coordinate axis was distributed over 2
processors. In this case, NTILES = 2 for each axis.  ZEUS-MP
imagines that these processors are arranged in a 3D "processor
coordinate system" in which each processor has a unique
set of coordinates in this system.  Our 8 processors would
therefore have coordinate values of (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0),
(1,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), and (1,1,1).  Each
element in the coordinate triple is stored in ZEUS-MP in the
3-element array COORDS.  For each processor, COORDS(1), COORDS(2),
and COORDS(3) collectively locate this processor in "process
topology," as it is officially known.

<p>
A processor's unique set of COORDS values is used to label the
output files it writes.  In our example, the processor with
COORDS = (0,0,0) will write hdf files named "hdfaa000000.XXX",
where 2 digits have been allowed for each value of COORDS, and
XXX is a numeric string giving the dump number (which begins with "000").  The first
dump in the simulation will write 8 files: hdfaa000000.000, hdfaa010000.000,
hdfaa000100.000, hdfaa010100.000, hdfaa000001.000, hdfaa010001.000, hdfaa000101.000,
and hdfaa010101.000.

<p>
You get the idea.  This convention is followed for all 3 data formats: HDF4
("hdfaa...."), ASCII ("usraa..."), and binary restart files ("resaa....").

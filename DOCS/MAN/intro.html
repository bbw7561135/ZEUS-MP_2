<h3><a name="summary"> The Short Story</a></h3>
<a name="summary">ZEUS-MP is the latest addition to the ZEUS line of
community application
codes developed by the </a><a href="http://cosmos.ucsd.edu/" target="cosmos">Laboratory
for
Computational Astrophysics</a>. The "MP" suffix denotes the
"multi-physics,"
"massively parallel," and "message passing" aspects of the code. The
physics
suite in this release of ZEUS-MP includes gas hydrodynamics, ideal MHD,
implicit flux-limited radiation diffusion (FLD), self gravity, and
multispecies
advection. The HD, MHD, and FLD modules can be used
on 1, 2, or 3-dimensional grids, in Cartesian, cylindrical, or
spherical
coordinate geometries.
Likewise, self-gravity is supported in all dimensions and can be
calculated with a variety of methods, depending on geometry,
dimensionality,
and boundary conditions. Methods include: (1) GM/r on 1D or 2D
spherical
grids; (2) a conjugate-gradient Poisson solver on 2D or 3D spherical
and
cylindrical grids; (3) a multigrid-based Poisson solver on 3D cartesian
grids with non-periodic boundary conditions, and (4) a Fast Fourier
Transform
solver for 3D cartesian grids with triply-periodic boundaries. External
point-mass potentials are also supported.<br>
<br>
<b><font size="4"><a name="versions">Multiple Versions of ZEUS-MP</a></font></b><br>
<p>
There now exist at least 3 different versions of ZEUS-MP which have
been made publicly available. The first of these was released directly
by the <a href="http://cosmos.ucsd.edu/" target="ucsd">Laboratory for
Computational
Astrophysics</a> in 1999 when the LCA was part of the
<a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu" target="uiuc">National Center for
Supercomputing
Applications</a>. </p>
<p>
A modified version of the original 1.0b code, currently (12/01/05)
dubbed version 1.5.8a,
has been distributed by John Vernaleo and Chris Reynolds on their
<a href="http://www.astro.umd.edu/%7Evernaleo/zeusmp.html" target="umd">web
site</a>.
Additional information about the code and a paper recently posted
to Astro-ph (Vernaleo and Reynolds 2005; astro-ph/0511501) is available
there.
</p>
<p>
The version of ZEUS-MP distributed on this page, which I am currently
calling version 2.0, shares a common ancestor (v1.0b) with Vernaleo's
ZEUS-MP v1.5.8a, but similarities end there. In what follows,
<b>NO COMMENTS MADE ABOUT V1.0B OR VERSION 2 SHOULD BE ASSUMED TO
APPLY TO V1.5.8A</b>.</p>
<p> The following discussion compares ZEUS-MP v2.0, distributed on this
web site, to ZEUS-MP v1.0b, the first public release of ZEUS-MP.
Differences between the two fall
into
three categories:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> <b>Available Physics:</b>
Flux-limited radiation diffusion (FLD) and multispecies fluid advection
are new additions to the ZEUS-MP physics set. </li>
  <li> <b>Application Flexibility:</b> Both the
HD and MHD modules in v1.0b were hard-wired for 3-D execution. In
version 2, HD, MHD, and RHD are possible in all dimensions on cartesian
(X-Y-Z), cylindrical (Z-R-Phi), and spherical (R-Theta-Phi) grids.
In addition, non-ideal equations of state are now supported, though
none are
included in this release. </li>
  <li> <b>Software Engineering:</b> In the
version 1.0b release, extensive use was made of the C preprocessor
(CPP)
to select included physics, geometry, problem size, dimensionality, and
parallel execution at compilation time. In version 2, the only CPP
macros which remain are those which expose MPI and MGMPI functions to
the compiler and a macro ("PROBLEM") identifying the name of the
problem-generator subroutine. Physics, geometry, and dimension
attributes are now set by integer and logical control parameters;
Fortran 90 ALLOCATE statements are used to allocate field arrays at
execution. As a result, <b>ZEUS-MP can now be
reconfigured for problem size, dimensionality, included physics, and
parallel topology at run time without recompilation.</b> </li>
</ol>
<font size="4"><b>BUGS in Version 1.0b!!</b></font><br>
<br>
ZEUS-MP v1.0b contains (at least) two undocumented and potentially
severe
bugs in the source code: <br>
<br>
<b>1.</b> <b>Subroutine tranx2.F: </b>values of
the cpp macro UNROLL_J other than 4 will produce incorrect source code.
<br>
<br>
<b>2.</b> <b>Subroutines tranx2.F and tranx3.F: </b>the
"xi" expressions are incorrect for curvilinear coordinates. Correct
expressions can be found in corresponding subroutines in Version 2.<br>

<h3>Numerical Overview</h3>
<a name="numerics">The overall numerical scheme adopted by ZEUS-MP is
the same as that employed
by earlier ZEUS codes. An operator-split scheme is adopted whereby in
the "source step", fluid
velocities and internal energies are updated due to the effects of body
forces, artificial viscosity, local heating/cooling/transport due
to radiation diffusion (if applicable), and PdV work. In the subsequent
"transport step," these fluid
velocities are used to advect the field variables (density, internal
energies, composition) through the computational mesh. A three-level
listing of the subroutine calls made during a hydro cycle is as
follows:
</a>
<ul>
  <a name="numerics"> <li> call GRAVITY (evaluate gravitational
potential)<br>
    <br>
If 1D --&gt; use GM/r <br>
If 2D --&gt; use GM/r OR call GRAV2D_CG (conjugate gradient Poisson

      <li> call PDV_D (add PdV work term to internal energy) </li>
    </ul>

        <br>
        <ul>

          <li> call MOMX2 (advect momentum densities) </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li> call ADVX3 (advect along "x3" axis) <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li> call TRANX3 (advect density, gas/radiation energies,
abundances) </li>
          <li> call MOMX3 (advect momentum densities) </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> call NUDT (compute timestep for next hydro cycle) </li>
  </a>
</ul>

<a name="numerics"><b>NOTE:</b> The order in which the ADVX*

<h3><a name="parallelism">Implementing Parallelism</a></h3>
<a name="parallelism">ZEUS-MP uses the <i>Message-Passing Interface</i>
(MPI) to achieve parallelism
in a distributed-memory model. ZEUS-MP uses spatial <i>domain
decomposition</i>
to subdivide and distribute the computational domain across the
processors
in a multi-process calculation. The domain can be subdivided along any
or all
of the computational axes which are "active" (i.e. have more than one
physical
zone) in a calculation.
</a>
<p><a name="parallelism">Because ZEUS-MP adopts a distributed-memory
approach, message-passing via MPI
must be used to update the information in the "ghost zones" bounding a
processor's
share of physical zones. In order to facilitate the overlap of
communication
and computation, <i>asynchronous message passing</i> is employed with <b>MPI_ISEND</b>
and <b>MPI_IRECV</b> function calls. These function calls are
interleaved with
Fortran DO loops which do actual computational work according to the
following
strategy: <br>
<br>
</a></p>
<ol>
  <a name="parallelism"> <li> Initiate send/receive requests for
boundary data to/from neighboring processors. </li>
  <li> Execute work on "interior" zones in local domain. </li>
  <li> Verify that MPI_ISEND/MPI_IRECV processes have finished. </li>
  <li> Execute work on boundary zones in local domain. </li>
  </a>
</ol>
<p>
<a name="parallelism">In a 3-D calculation, ghost "faces" must be
exchanged along 3 coordinates,
and for corner ghost zones to be updated correctly, the updates along
axis "n" must complete before the updates along axis "n+1" are
initiated.
Therefore, the strategy outlined above is applied along <i>each</i>
active coordinate axis, which means that the "interior" domain is
subdivided
into several pieces so that the communication/computation overlap
strategy
may be used along each axis. Subroutines that employ this strategy
include:
</a></p>
<ol>
  <a name="parallelism"> <li> EOS_D </li>
  <li> FORCES_D </li>
  <li> AVISC_D </li>
  <li> PDV_D </li>
  <li> ADVX1 </li>
  <li> ADVX2 </li>
  <li> ADVX3 </li>
  <li> NUDT </li>
  </a>
</ol>
<p>
<a name="parallelism">In addition to enhancing parallel efficiency,
this "interleaving" strategy
makes the subroutines listed above quite complicated in structure. For
example, examination of ADVX1 (source file advx1.F) shows multiple
occurrences
of the TRANX1 and MOMX1 subroutine calls, each operating over a
different
range of zone indices, interspersed with calls to BVAL* subroutines
which
do the heaving lifting of MPI. On scalable hardware architectures,
however,
this strategy has proven quite effective at promoting parallel
efficiency.

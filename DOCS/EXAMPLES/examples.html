<h4>Overview</h4>

<P>
This section presents results from 4 different sample calculations, each
of which is hyperlinked from the sub-menu on the left.  The first two
calculations are "blast wave" problems in which a strongly overpressured
spherical balls expands into a low-density surrounding medium.  Each of
these is done in two dimensions and distributed across 4 processors.
The first calculation is pure gas dynamics; the second adds an initially
uniform magnetic field to the problem.  Data is dumped in HDF format;
the "zmp_pp.x" post-processing executable is used to assemble the individual
per-process data blocks into one global data dump.

<p>
The third test is the pressureless collapse problem documented in
Paper I of the ZEUS-2D trilogy (<b>ApJ</b> Supplment; Volume 80).
This test is included as an example in which self-gravity is included.
Data is dumped in ASCII format; the problem is run on one processor.

<p>
The fourth problem is a 1-D RHD problem following the evolution
of supercritical radiating shocks.  Data is dumped in ASCII format;
the problem is run on 1 processor.

<h4>Post-Processing HDF files</h4>

<P>
When HDF data is dumped, one assemble the data files written at one time
slice from each processor into a global data file using the "zmp_pp.x"
post-processing executable.  The source code for the processor is located
in the <b>zeusmp2/pp</b> subdirectory.  To build the code, simply type
"make compile" -- the executable is placed in <b>exe90</b> along with
zeusmp.x.

<p>
To run the post-processor, simply type "zmp_pp.x" and follow the on-screen
directions.  An example screen session from the assembly of files for the
blast wave calculation is provided in <a href="./zmp_pp_tty.txt">this text
file</a>. In this example, I typed "hsplice" as the task to perform.  The
code then printed information about file ID, the number of tiles to assemble,
and the number of zones in each tile.  The HSPLICE subprogram then asked
for the dump number of the files to assemble.  There are only two, with
".000" and ".001" suffices.  It is sufficient to enter only the number of
digits needed to identify the number.  After having processed both data
dumps, I then entered "-1" to quit the HSPLICE subprogram, and then I
typed "quit" to exit the post-processor.

<p>
In both blast wave problems, the zmp_inp file is configured to run on
four processors, with the both the 1- and 2-coordinates distributed
over processors.  The file was further configured (in namelist IOCON)
so that HDF dumps are written at the beginning and end of the calculation
with no intermediate dumps.  We therefore have two sets of HDF files
at the end of the calculation, which runs to an evolution time of 0.005
seconds:

<p>
Use of zmp_pp.x as shown in the screen session results in two global data files:
"hdfaa.000" and "hdfaa.001".  These data files can then be visualized as the user
sees fit.
